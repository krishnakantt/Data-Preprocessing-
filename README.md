# 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing for Machine Learning
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing raw datasets to make them suitable for machine learning models. It demonstrates a complete pipeline including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and outlier detection.

## 📌 Objective
To build a robust and reusable preprocessing pipeline that:
- Cleans raw data
- Prepares it for machine learning algorithms
- Improves data quality and model accuracy
